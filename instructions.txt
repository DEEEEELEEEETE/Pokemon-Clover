This project is designed with armips.exe at the center, and will eventually include grit to compile images.

HOW TO COMPILE STUFF
1) Download a .zip of the repository and extract it. It'll automatically be named Pokemon-Clover-master.
2) Put a CLEAN FireRed ROM in the main folder, and name it clover.gba.
3) Apply base.ips to clover.gba
4) Open your command prompt, navigate to Pokemon-Clover-master or whatever else you've renamed the folder to.
5) Type armips.exe main.asm -sym offsets.txt, then hit enter.

HOW TO ADD FILES
When we get images, I'll create a folder called images, and two subfolders called pic and bin. Put pictures into pic, grit will compress those and put them in bin.

Scripts that use our script_defines.asm file should be put in a folder called scripts, and ASM and C should go in a folder named source.

ASM AND SCRIPT STYLE
Comments are added through ;
Instead of #org for scripts, use this style;
    start:
    call label
    end
    
    label:
    return
.thumb is required at the top of every .asm file.
